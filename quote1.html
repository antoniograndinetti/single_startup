                        <h2>Why we all need a single startup market in Europe now</h2>
                        <p>
                          Europe has a potential market of 500 million customers but European
                          entrepreneurs can’t take full advantage of its potential, because of fragmentation
                          in the various member states and operational complexity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But what if suddenly startups could operate within Europe like their US
                          competitors can do in America? What if startups could operate within a unique,
                          simple and competitive legal framework for corporate, labour, tax/fiscal
                          incentives, stock options, bankruptcy matters?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          A lot of the friction that makes scaling in Europe difficult for startups would
                          disappear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          When we started to fly this idea at the Unicorn Forum and the Founder Forum,
                          we called it a ‘Single Startup Market’: a new corporate regime designed to build
                          a bigger, more robust and fluid market for innovation in Europe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The vast majority of startups in the US have a simple and defined set of rules.
                          Delaware based, stadard entities, with standard capital structures, classes of
                          shares, option plans and pretty standard legal frameworks. Operating in the
                          Single Startup Market should as simple as it is to operating from Palo Alto a
                          Delaware company. Sort of a ‘Delaware’ of Europe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          All the efforts of European policy makers are doing to armonize rules are
                          important and should be pursued as much as possible, however they will take
                          years to complete. But startups don’t have so much time: global competition is
                          fierce and challenges are scaling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This idea came about from the experience we had in Italy in the past few years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In 2012 President Monti’s Government issued the Italian Startup Act. The
                          Government took notice that the germs of a new startup ecosystem were born in
                          Italy and there was the need to quickly create a better environment with more
                          humane beaurocracy and ‘international standard’ corporate tools. But Italy
                          didn’t have much time those days, and neither Premier Monti. The ‘Startup Act’
                          was released in his last days of government.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Designing a policy that would touch corporate, fiscal, labour laws and regulations
                          would be so complex and take too much time, if such changes apply to every
                          company. A dead end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          There was the need to find a way to quickly hack the system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The solution has been to create a special regime, accessible to qualified early
                          stage startups (less than 5 years old), with its own public online registry
                          http://startup.registroimprese.it/index_en.html. In Italy if you qualify as
                          ‘innovative startup’ you are on this list where you can enjoy a enter a special set
                          of rules on labour, bankrupcy, tax and several other corporate matters. Plus you
                          have access to ‘things’ that ordinary companies cannot enjoy such as equity
                          crowdfunding, startup visa and many other tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          So the idea was, what if the same kind hack could be replicated on pan-european
                          scale?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The European Union has gone long ways in armonizing markets, policies,
                          regulations, culture and create a more homogeneous single market, but of course
                          it is a huge challenge and in any case it will take years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          National policy makers, at present, have no sufficient incentives to harmonise
                          their regulations toward a single market at large. But possibly since such policy
                          experiment would touch only a limited number of entities, National entities
                          might consider the Single Startup Market in their best interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Startups are today a key resource in Europe to build competitiveness and
                          growth, each smaller innovation ecosystem suddenly would be right into a new
                          Europe. A single legal framework would suddenly bring agility and easier cross
                          contamination for European startups, cultures and ideas, making the overall
                          innovation ecosystem stronger, bigger and more attractive for investors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And most of all, would create a system to leverage on our strenght in Europe: our
                          diversity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you, like me think a Single Startup Market would work for your startup, let us
                          know by signing the Unicorn’s call to policy makers.
