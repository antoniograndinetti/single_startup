                        <h2>The entrepreneurs call <br/>for a Single Startup Market is up!</h2>
                        <p>
                            Europe has a potential market of 500 million customers but European entrepreneurs
                            can’t take full advantage of its potential, because of fragmentation in the various
                            member state jurisdictions. The effort from the Commission and member states to harmonize
                            European legislation must continue. We at the Unicorn Forum and Founders Forum believe
                            radical policy action must be taken to bring to scale the European startup ecosystem,
                            and today are calling for a Single Startup Market, with support from some of the world’s
                            most influential startup founders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The objective is to create a single legal framework for qualified startups with
                          standard rules across countries within the European Community. A special corporate
                          regime accessible to qualified startups would facilitate a unique, simple and
                          competitive legal framework for corporate, labour, tax/fiscal incentives, stock
                          options, bankruptcy matters. Starting a business and operating across multiple
                          different European countries should be as simple as it is to operate in a single country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          National policy makers, at present, have no sufficient incentives to harmonise
                          their regulations toward a single market for European startups. A single legal
                          framework will bring agility and easier cross contamination for European startups,
                          making the overall innovation ecosystem stronger, bigger and more attractive for investors.
                        </p>
